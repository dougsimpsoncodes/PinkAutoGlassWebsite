## 🚀 Deployment Options

### Option 1: Vercel (Recommended)
**Why**: Vercel is made by Next.js creators, zero-config deployment

#### Steps:
```bash
# 1. Install Vercel CLI (if not already installed)
npm i -g vercel

# 2. Login to Vercel
vercel login

# 3. Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# OR use Vercel Dashboard:
# - Connect GitHub repository
# - Auto-deploys on push to main branch
```

**Environment Variables** (if needed):
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_GA_MEASUREMENT_ID` - Google Analytics ID
- Any API keys or secrets

**Post-Deployment:**
- Custom domain: Configure DNS at pinkautoglass.com
- SSL: Automatic via Vercel
- CDN: Automatic via Vercel Edge Network

---

### Option 2: Netlify

#### Steps:
```bash
# 1. Build command
npm run build

# 2. Publish directory
.next

# 3. Deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

**netlify.toml** configuration:
```toml
[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = ".next"

[[redirects]]
  from = "/*"
  to = "/index.html"
  status = 200
```

---

### Option 3: Self-Hosted (VPS/AWS/DigitalOcean)

#### Requirements:
- Node.js 18+
- PM2 for process management
- Nginx for reverse proxy

#### Steps:
```bash
# 1. Clone repository on server
git clone [repo-url]
cd pinkautoglasswebsite

# 2. Install dependencies
npm ci --production

# 3. Build for production
npm run build

# 4. Start with PM2
pm2 start npm --name "pink-auto-glass" -- start
pm2 save
pm2 startup

# 5. Configure Nginx reverse proxy
# /etc/nginx/sites-available/pinkautoglass
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name pinkautoglass.com www.pinkautoglass.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection 'upgrade';
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_cache_bypass $http_upgrade;
    }
