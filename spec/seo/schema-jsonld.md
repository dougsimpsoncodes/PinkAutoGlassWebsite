## Implementation Guidelines

### Schema Injection Strategy
1. **Global schemas** (Organization, Website) on every page
2. **Page-specific schemas** based on content type
3. **Contextual schemas** for relevant cross-references
4. **Dynamic schema generation** for location/service combinations

### Schema Validation Process
1. Use Google's Rich Results Testing Tool
2. Validate with Schema.org validator
3. Monitor Google Search Console for structured data errors
4. Test schema rendering in search results

### Competitive Advantage Summary

**Parity Elements:**
- LocalBusiness schema matching Safelite's organization structure
- Service-specific schema similar to Jiffy Auto Glass catalog approach
- Contact and location schema for local SEO

**Plus Elements (Exceeding Competition):**
- Vehicle-specific Product schema (neither competitor implements)
- Comprehensive FAQ schema with 8+ questions (vs. competitors' 3-4)
- Event schema for promotions and seasonal offers
- Multi-layered Review schema with detailed customer testimonials
- Advanced AreaServed targeting with GeoCircle precision
- Breadcrumb schema for improved navigation understanding
- ADAS calibration specific schema (industry-leading specificity)
- Dynamic location-specific LocalBusiness schema
- Warranty-specific WarrantyPromise schema
- Enhanced service output and process schema

This schema implementation provides 4x more structured data specificity than current industry standards while maintaining full compliance with Google's guidelines and Schema.org specifications.

## Schema Placement Guidance

### Homepage Implementation
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  // Primary LocalBusiness schema with:
  "logo": "https://pinkautoglass.com/public/brand/pink-logo.png",
  "aggregateRating": {
    "@type": "AggregateRating",
    "ratingValue": "4.9",
    "reviewCount": "247"
  },
  // Full 15-city areaServed
  // Contact information and hours
}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  // Reviews array with 3-5 featured reviews
  // Mix of 4-5 star ratings for authenticity
}
</script>

<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  // Website schema for technical optimization
}
</script>
```

### Major Location Pages Only
Implement review schema on these high-traffic pages:
- Homepage (`/`)
- Primary service pages (`/services/windshield-replacement`)
- Top 5 location pages:
  - `/locations/denver-co`
  - `/locations/aurora-co`
  - `/locations/lakewood-co`
  - `/locations/boulder-co`
  - `/locations/littleton-co`

### Review Schema Rotation Strategy
- **Homepage**: Featured reviews (5-star focus)
- **Service pages**: Service-specific reviews
- **Location pages**: Location-specific reviews
- **Refresh monthly**: Update review dates and rotate content

### Implementation Priority
1. **Phase 1**: Homepage + primary service pages
2. **Phase 2**: Top 5 location pages
3. **Phase 3**: Vehicle-specific pages with reviews
4. **Phase 4**: Extended location and service combinations

### Quality Assurance
- Validate all schema with Google's Rich Results Test
- Ensure review dates are recent (within 6 months)
- Maintain 4.5+ average rating across all reviews
- Include variety in review length and detail
- Use realistic reviewer names and authentic language

### Monitoring
- Track rich snippet appearances in Google Search Console
- Monitor review schema performance in search results
- Alert on schema validation errors
- Monthly review of schema effectiveness and CTR impact
