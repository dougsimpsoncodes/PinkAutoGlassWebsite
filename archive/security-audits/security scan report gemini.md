### **Pre-Commit Security Scan Report**

**Overall Assessment:**

While significant progress has been made in hardening the application's runtime security (RLS, validation), a critical operational security failure has been identified. The project is currently configured to commit all secret keys and API tokens directly into the Git repository history, which would lead to an immediate and total compromise of all connected services (Supabase, Twilio, Resend) upon being pushed.

**Action: DO NOT COMMIT OR PUSH ANY CODE until the critical issues below are resolved.**

---

### **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES: DO NOT COMMIT**

**1. All Project Secrets Are Exposed in `.env.local`**

*   **Finding:** The file `.env.local` contains hardcoded, active secret keys for multiple services.
    *   `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`
    *   `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID` & `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`
    *   `RESEND_API_KEY`
    *   `INTERNAL_API_KEY`
    *   `GEO_API_KEY`
*   **Impact:** **Total System Compromise.** If this file is committed, these keys will be permanently recorded in your Git history. Anyone who views the repository will have full administrative access to your database, and full control over your SMS, email, and geolocation services, leading to potential data theft and financial loss.

**2. `.gitignore` is Missing Entries for Environment Files**

*   **Finding:** The `.gitignore` file does not contain any rules to ignore `.env.local` or other `.env.*` files.
*   **Impact:** This is the direct cause of the vulnerability above. Because the file is not ignored, `git` will track it and include it in all commits. This is the single most critical misconfiguration in the repository.

---

### **ðŸŸ¡ HIGH-PRIORITY VULNERABILITIES**

**1. Unsafe Use of Service Role Key in API Routes**

*   **Finding:** The API routes for notifications and SMS (`/src/app/api/booking/notify/route.ts` and `/src/app/api/sms/confirmation/route.ts`) are still configured to use the master `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`.
*   **Impact:** Even if the key is not exposed in Git, using it to handle user-triggered events is a major security risk. It bypasses all RLS policies and gives the API process excessive permissions, increasing the blast radius if a vulnerability is found in that code.
*   **Recommendation:** These routes should be refactored to use secure, RLS-aware database functions (`SECURITY DEFINER`) or a more limited, specific API key if necessary. The service role key should be reserved for trusted administrative scripts only.

**2. Conflicting and Insecure Migration Files**

*   **Finding:** The `/supabase/migrations/` directory contains multiple SQL files that define RLS policies. Specifically, `2025-08-21_fix_rls_policies.sql` contains dangerously permissive rules (`GRANT INSERT ON leads TO anon;` with no checks) that directly conflict with the secure rules in `20250821090822_hardened_rls_rev2.sql`.
*   **Impact:** The final security state of your database depends entirely on the order these migrations are run in. This ambiguity is a significant risk and will lead to inconsistent security behavior across different environments.
*   **Recommendation:** Delete all but the single, canonical, hardened RLS migration file (`20250821090822_hardened_rls_rev2.sql`). There must be only one source of truth for your security policies.

### **âœ… Security Best Practices Confirmed**

*   **Primary Booking API:** The main `/api/booking/submit/route.ts` endpoint is well-secured. It correctly uses the `anon` key, has rate-limiting, and relies on RLS for security.
*   **Input Validation:** The use of a Zod schema (`BookingSchema`) for validation in the API is a robust and effective practice.
*   **No Hardcoded Secrets in App Code:** My scan confirms that secrets are being correctly read from `process.env` within the application code itself, which is the proper technique. The failure is in how the `.env.local` file that populates `process.env` is handled.

### **Final Pre-Commit Checklist**

**You must complete these steps before running `git commit`:**

1.  **[IMMEDIATE] Create a `.gitignore` file** at the root of your project if it doesn't exist, or add the following lines to your existing one. This will tell Git to ignore your secrets file.
    ```
    # Environment variables
    .env.local
    .env
    .env.*
    ```
2.  **[IMMEDIATE] Run `git rm --cached .env.local`**. If you have already accidentally staged the file (`git add .`), this command will un-stage it so it doesn't get committed.
3.  **[IMMEDIATE] Rotate All Exposed Keys.** Since the keys have been present in a tracked file, you must assume they are compromised. Go to the dashboards for Supabase, Twilio, and Resend and regenerate **all** API keys and tokens.
4.  **[HIGH] Consolidate SQL Migrations.** Remove the conflicting and insecure RLS policy files from your `/supabase/migrations/` directory.
5.  **[HIGH] Plan the Refactor of `notify` and `sms` APIs** to remove the use of the service role key.

After these steps are complete, your repository will be in a safe state to commit and push.
