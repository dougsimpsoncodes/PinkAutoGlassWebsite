**Visual design:**

### 2. Footer Navigation (`src/components/footer.tsx`)
**Services Section:**
- Added "View All Services â†’" link (line 77-82)
- Pink accent color for visual hierarchy

**Company Section:**

- Positioned between Blog and Careers

**Already existing:**

## Next Steps (Suggested)

### Phase 1 Complete âœ…
- [x] Create hub pages (/services, /locations, /vehicles)
- [x] Create comprehensive test coverage
- [x] Add navigation to all pages

### Phase 2 Options
1. **Location Page Enrichment**: Add detailed content to 9 city pages (denver, aurora, etc.)
2. **SEO Optimization**: Add meta tags, improve schema markup
3. **Blog Integration**: Link blog posts to relevant hub pages
4. **Analytics**: Add tracking for navigation clicks
5. **Performance**: Optimize images, implement lazy loading
6. **Accessibility**: Full WCAG 2.1 AA audit

### Immediate Priorities
Based on LLM feedback from original plan:
- Consider adding breadcrumbs to all hub pages (component exists: `src/components/Breadcrumbs.tsx`)
- Add structured data for site navigation (SiteNavigationElement schema)
- Optimize images on hub pages (especially vehicle images)

## Technical Notes

### Logo Sizing Issue (Fixed)
**Problem**: Original logo (194px height) with absolute positioning overlapped navigation links

**Solution**:
- Changed to flex layout (removed absolute positioning)
- Responsive sizing: `h-12 md:h-16` (48px mobile, 64px desktop)
- Maintains aspect ratio while preventing overlap

### Navigation Accessibility
- Semantic HTML (`<nav role="navigation">`)
- Skip to content link
- ARIA labels on links
- Keyboard navigable
- Focus states visible

### Mobile Considerations
- Stacked layout on small screens
- Touch-friendly spacing
- Readable font sizes
- No hamburger menu needed (4 links fit comfortably)

## Browser Compatibility
Tested on:
- âœ… Chromium (latest)
- ðŸŸ¡ Firefox (assumed compatible, not tested)
- ðŸŸ¡ WebKit/Safari (assumed compatible, not tested)
- ðŸŸ¡ Mobile Chrome (assumed compatible, not tested)
- ðŸŸ¡ Mobile Safari (assumed compatible, not tested)

**Recommendation**: Run cross-browser tests before production deployment:
