            answer: 'Yes, but it requires controlled conditions. Mobile repair services can perform repairs in your garage or parking structure where it\'s above freezing.

            answer: 'In Colorado\'s winter temperature swings, a chip can spread into a 6+ inch crack literally overnight - sometimes in just hours if you use your defroster improperly. Edge chips and star chips are particularly fast to spread. If you notice a new chip, consider it urgent and get it repaired within days, not weeks.'

            question: 'How long does a windshield repair last?',
            answer: 'A quality repair should last the entire remaining life of your windshield - often 10+ years. The resin used in professional repairs is designed to withstand temperature cycling, UV exposure, and stress. It expands and contracts with the glass through Colorado\'s temperature extremes. Repairs don\'t weaken over time if done correctly initially.'

            question: 'Can I repair a chip myself with a kit from the auto parts store?',

However, professional repairs use better resin, more powerful vacuum equipment to fully clean the damage, and UV curing lights for proper bonding. A professional repair costs $0 with insurance in Colorado - there\'s little financial incentive to DIY. If you use a DIY kit incorrectly, you may make the damage unrepairable and force a replacement.'

If your insurance covers windshield replacement, they must also cover required ADAS calibration - it\'s part of proper windshield replacement on ADAS-equipped vehicles, not a separate service. Insurance companies cannot deny calibration coverage if it\'s required for your vehicle. The glass shop should include calibration in the insurance claim automatically.'

Second, test the systems in a safe environment - ensure lane departure warnings activate when you drift, that adaptive cruise control maintains proper distance, etc. If anything feels wrong or warning lights appear, return to the shop immediately for recalibration.'

            question: 'Can I drive with a rock chip or will it spread while driving?',
            answer: 'Yes, you can drive with a small chip, but minimize your driving until it\'s repaired. Driving creates vibration and stress that can cause spreading - especially on rough roads or highways. If possible, schedule repair for the next day and avoid long drives until then. If you must drive, avoid slamming doors, rough roads, and temperature extremes (don\'t blast AC or heat on the windshield).'

            question: 'Will tapping the chip with clear tape really prevent spreading?',
            answer: 'Yes, but it\'s a temporary measure, not a permanent solution. Clear tape prevents moisture and dirt from entering the chip, which slows contamination and spreading. It also provides minor structural support. However, tape doesn\'t prevent temperature stress or vibration damage - it just buys you time (24-48 hours max) to get professional repair. Don\'t rely on tape as a long-term fix.'

          {
            question: 'What if my chip is right in my line of sight - can it still be repaired?',
            answer: 'Technically yes, but you might prefer replacement. Chips in the driver\'s direct line of sight can be repaired, but even a perfect repair leaves slight optical distortion. While safe and legal, it can be visually distracting. If the chip is small and outside your main sight line, repair is fine. If it\'s directly in your view, consider replacement for better visibility - many insurance policies cover replacement for safety-related vision issues.'
          },
          {
            question: 'How long will a professional chip repair last?',
            answer: 'A quality professional repair should last the entire remaining life of your windshield - often 10+ years. The resin bonds permanently to the glass and is designed to withstand temperature cycling, UV exposure, and stress. Quality shops offer lifetime warranties on chip repairs. If the repair fails or spreads (which is rare with proper initial repair), they\'ll re-repair it free or credit the cost toward a windshield replacement.'
