            answer: 'Yes, but it requires controlled conditions. Mobile repair services can perform repairs in your garage or parking structure where it\'s above freezing. Some shops have heated mobile units. The resin needs to be at least 40°F to flow properly, so outdoor repair in sub-freezing weather isn\'t recommended.'

            question: 'How quickly can a chip spread in cold weather?',
            answer: 'In Colorado\'s winter temperature swings, a chip can spread into a 6+ inch crack literally overnight - sometimes in just hours if you use your defroster improperly. Edge chips and star chips are particularly fast to spread. If you notice a new chip, consider it urgent and get it repaired within days, not weeks.'

            question: 'Will a windshield chip repair hold up through multiple winters?',
            answer: 'Yes, a properly performed chip repair should last the lifetime of your windshield regardless of temperature cycling. The resin used is designed to expand and contract with glass through temperature changes. Quality shops offer lifetime warranties on chip repairs - if it fails, they\'ll re-repair or replace for free.'

            answer: 'Small chips (smaller than a quarter) are generally safe for driving, but avoid using defrosters on high and be gentle with temperature changes. However, chips near the edge or in your line of sight should be repaired immediately before any winter highway driving - the vibration and temperature stress of highway speeds can cause rapid spreading.'
