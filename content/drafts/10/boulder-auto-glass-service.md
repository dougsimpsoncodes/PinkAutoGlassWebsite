## Frequently Asked Questions

### Do you service vehicles parked on CU Boulder campus?
Yes, we coordinate with campus parking services to provide mobile auto glass service on campus. We understand campus regulations and work within university guidelines to serve students, faculty, and staff.

### Can you handle vehicles modified for outdoor recreation?
Absolutely. Boulder's outdoor enthusiasts often modify vehicles with roof racks, bike carriers, and adventure equipment. We're experienced with these modifications and ensure proper glass installation around aftermarket accessories.

### What's the difference between OEM and aftermarket glass?
OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer) glass meets the exact specifications of your vehicle's original windshield. Aftermarket glass meets safety standards but may have slight variations in thickness, tint, or features. We recommend OEM for optimal performance.

Boulder's elevation creates greater temperature differentials and UV exposure, which can accelerate glass damage. Our technicians understand these conditions and use appropriate materials and techniques for high-altitude service.

While our standard service covers the Boulder area, we can coordinate emergency service for vehicles in nearby mountain locations depending on accessibility and weather conditions. Contact us to discuss specific situations.
