## üè¢ COMPETITOR BRAND SEARCHES

You're showing ads when people search for competitors. This can work (see "tavos auto glass" converting), but most are wasting impressions:

### Competitor Terms Detected:

### üéØ Strategy Recommendation:

**Option A (Aggressive):** Keep competitor terms but craft specific ad copy like:
- "Better than [Competitor]? See what our customers say!"
- "Local alternative to [Competitor] - Same day service"

**Option B (Conservative):** Add all competitor names as **negative keywords** to focus budget on intent-based searches

**Recommended:** Start with Option A for "tavos" (since it's converting), add the rest as negative keywords

   - **Problem:** Same as above
   - **Fix:** Add call extensions, emphasize "mobile service"

4. **"windshield chip repair"** - **14 impressions**, 0 clicks
