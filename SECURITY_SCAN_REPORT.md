## Recommendations for Production

1. **Before Deployment:**
   - Set strong, unique values for all environment variables
   - Enable Supabase RLS policies in production
   - Configure proper CORS origins
   - Set up monitoring and alerting

2. **Regular Maintenance:**
   - Run `npm audit` weekly
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Rotate API keys quarterly
   - Review access logs regularly

3. **Additional Security Measures:**
   - Implement rate limiting on all endpoints
   - Add CAPTCHA to prevent automated submissions
   - Set up Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Enable DDoS protection

## Compliance Status
- ✅ GDPR compliant (privacy policy, consent management)
- ✅ CCPA compliant (data handling practices)
