3. Update application code to try new secret, fallback to old
4. Deploy and verify functionality
5. Remove old secret from Vercel
6. Update documentation with rotation date

**Emergency Rotation (Breach):**
1. **IMMEDIATELY** invalidate compromised secret in service dashboard
2. Generate replacement secret
3. Update Vercel environment variables
4. Force redeploy: `vercel --prod --force`
5. Verify application functionality
6. Audit access logs for unauthorized usage
7. File incident report

### 1.6 Developer Handoff

When transferring project ownership:
1. Rotate ALL secrets before transfer
2. Provide new owner with access to Vercel dashboard
3. Document location of all secrets
4. Revoke previous owner's access to all services
5. Update emergency contact information

### 1.7 Secret Scanning Enforcement

**Pre-Commit Hook (Mandatory):**

- ‚ùå Cannot: Access admin functions or sensitive data

**Service Role Key Usage (Server-Side Only):**
- ‚úÖ Use for: Admin operations, automated processing, background jobs
- ‚úÖ Bypasses: All RLS policies (use with extreme caution)
- ‚ùå Never use for: Direct client calls, front-end code
- ‚ùå Never expose: In client bundles, logs, or error messages

**Database Direct Access:**
- ‚úÖ Use for: Emergency maintenance, migrations, backups
- ‚ùå Never use for: Application runtime, API routes
- üîí Restrict to: DevOps team, database administrators
- üìù Audit: All direct database access logged and reviewed monthly

### 2.3 Third-Party Service Access Levels

**Twilio (SMS Provider) - When Implemented:**
- Use restricted API keys scoped to specific messaging services
- Separate keys for dev/staging/production

### 2.4 Row-Level Security (RLS) Requirements

**All Database Tables Must:**
- ‚úÖ Have RLS enabled (`ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY`)
- ‚úÖ Have explicit policies for INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE
- ‚úÖ Default deny (no policy = no access)
- ‚úÖ Be tested with anon key to verify restrictions

**Leads Table Policies:**
```sql
-- Anon key can INSERT new leads (booking submissions)
CREATE POLICY "anon_insert_leads" ON leads
  FOR INSERT
  TO anon
  WITH CHECK (true);

-- Anon key CANNOT read leads (prevents data leakage)
CREATE POLICY "anon_no_select_leads" ON leads
  FOR SELECT
  TO anon
  USING (false);

-- Service role has full access (admin operations)
-- (Implicit - service role bypasses RLS)
```

**Uploads Bucket Policies:**
- Anonymous users: Cannot list files, cannot download without signed URL
