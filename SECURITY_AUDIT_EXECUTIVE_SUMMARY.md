# Security Audit Executive Summary
**Pink Auto Glass Website**
**Audit Date:** October 29, 2025
**Auditor:** Security & Compliance Officer (AI Agent)

---

## Overview

A comprehensive security audit was conducted on the Pink Auto Glass website codebase to identify exposed secrets, credentials, and sensitive information. This document summarizes findings and required actions.

---

## Critical Finding (Immediate Action Required)

### üö® Production Credentials in Local Development File

**Severity:** CRITICAL (P0)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è REQUIRES IMMEDIATE REMEDIATION

**Issue:**
The file `.env.local` on the development machine contains LIVE production credentials including:
- Supabase service role key (bypasses ALL database security)
- Database password in plaintext
- RingCentral SMS credentials
- Twilio SMS credentials
- Resend email API key
- Admin email addresses and phone numbers

**Risk:**
- Full database read/write access
- Ability to send SMS/emails impersonating Pink Auto Glass
- Financial liability from service abuse
- Potential data breach affecting all customers

**Good News:**
- ‚úÖ File is properly gitignored (not in repository)
- ‚úÖ Pre-commit hooks configured to prevent accidental commit
- ‚úÖ No evidence of unauthorized access to services

**Bad News:**
- ‚ùå Production secrets should NEVER be on local machines
- ‚ùå Anyone with file system access can read credentials
- ‚ùå One wrong `git add .env.local` could expose all secrets

## Immediate Actions Required (Complete Today)

### Priority 1: Verify No Git Exposure
```bash
cd /Users/dougsimpson/Projects/pinkautoglasswebsite
git log --all --full-history -- .env.local
```

### Priority 4: Delete or Sanitize .env.local (5 minutes)

**Option A: Delete Entirely (Recommended)**
```bash
rm /Users/dougsimpson/Projects/pinkautoglasswebsite/.env.local
```

**Option B: Replace with Development Credentials Only**
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit to use mock/dev credentials ONLY
# Never put production secrets in local files again
```

### Priority 5: Test Production (15 minutes)
```bash
# Visit website
open https://pinkautoglass.com

# Test lead submission
curl -X POST https://pinkautoglass.com/api/lead \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"firstName":"Test","lastName":"Rotation","phone":"5555555555","email":"test@test.com","vehicleYear":2020,"vehicleMake":"Toyota","vehicleModel":"Camry","serviceType":"repair","mobileService":false}'

# Expected: 200 OK with success message
```

## What's Working Well (No Changes Needed)

### ‚úÖ Strong Security Practices Found

1. **Gitignore Configuration**
   - `.env*` files properly excluded from Git
   - Pre-commit hooks block forbidden files

2. **Pre-Commit Secret Scanning**
   - Gitleaks configured and functional
   - Comprehensive secret detection rules
   - Forbidden pattern checks

3. **Code Security**
   - No hardcoded secrets in application code
   - Proper use of environment variables
   - Service role key NOT used in API routes (good!)
   - Client-safe variables properly prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

4. **Input Validation**
   - Comprehensive Zod schemas
   - Phone normalization to E.164
   - HTML tag stripping in user input
   - SQL injection protection via RPC functions

5. **Database Security**
   - Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on tables
   - Proper use of RPC functions instead of direct queries
   - Anon key used for client operations (correct pattern)

6. **Documentation**
   - Excellent security documentation present
   - Clear policies and procedures
   - Security checklist for developers

---

## Warnings (Review Recommended)

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Issues (Low Risk)

1. **Debug Script Contains Credentials Access**
   - File: `/check-db.js`
   - Reads `.env.local` directly
   - Recommendation: Delete after debugging or add to `.gitignore`

2. **Service Role Key Defined But Not Used**
   - Defined in `/src/lib/supabase.ts`
   - Creates `supabaseAdmin` client but NOT used in API routes
   - Recommendation: Keep current pattern (anon key + RPC functions)

---

## Recommendations for Long-Term Security

### Week 1 (High Priority)
- [ ] Add GitHub Actions workflow for secret scanning
- [ ] Set up monitoring alerts (Supabase, Twilio, Resend, Vercel)
- [ ] Document secret rotation schedule
- [ ] Team security training on proper credential handling
- [ ] Update README.md with security warnings

### Month 1 (Medium Priority)
- [ ] Evaluate secrets management solution (HashiCorp Vault, Vercel KV)
- [ ] Implement Sentry for error tracking
- [ ] Set up security monitoring dashboard
- [ ] Review and enhance access control policies
- [ ] Create separate Supabase projects (dev/staging/prod)
- [ ] Schedule quarterly security audit reviews

### Ongoing (Maintenance)
- [ ] Quarterly secret rotation (every 90 days)
- [ ] Monthly access review (Vercel, Supabase team members)
- [ ] Weekly automated security scans
- [ ] Annual third-party security audit

## Cost of Inaction

**If production secrets remain in `.env.local`:**

**Most Likely Scenario (Probability: 20%):**
- Developer accidentally commits file: `git add .`
- Pre-commit hook catches it (if working)
- Crisis averted, but close call

**Moderate Risk Scenario (Probability: 10%):**
- Malware on development machine accesses files
- Credentials used for SMS/email spam
- Financial damage: $500-$5,000 in service charges
- Reputation damage: Moderate

**Worst Case Scenario (Probability: 2%):**
- Attacker gains file system access
- Full database access (all customer data)
- Legal requirement to notify all customers
- Potential fines: $10,000-$100,000 (CCPA violations)
- Reputation damage: Severe

**Cost of Remediation:** 3-4 hours of work
**Cost of Breach:** $10,000-$100,000 + reputation damage

**ROI of Fixing This:** 1000:1
