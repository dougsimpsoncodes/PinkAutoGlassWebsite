### Words to Avoid

- "Synergy" (just don't)

### Messaging to Avoid
- "We're the cheapest" (focus on value)
- "Quick fix" (suggests temporary solution)
- "No job too small" (sounds like we lack expertise)
- "We do it all" (stay focused on auto glass)

## Implementation Guidelines

### Content Review Checklist
- [ ] Mobile-first: Does it work on small screens?
- [ ] Scannable: Can users quickly understand the key points?
- [ ] Action-oriented: Does it tell users what to do next?
- [ ] Trustworthy: Does it build confidence?
- [ ] Local: Does it feel relevant to our community?

### Voice Consistency
Every piece of copy should pass the "Would our customers say this?" test. If it sounds like marketing speak instead of helpful advice from a trusted local business, revise it.

Our voice is the digital equivalent of our best technician explaining a repair to a neighbor â€“ knowledgeable, helpful, and genuinely caring about their safety and convenience.
