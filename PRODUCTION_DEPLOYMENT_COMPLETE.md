---

## What Was Deployed

### 1. TypeScript Build Fixes ‚úÖ

Fixed multiple TypeScript compilation errors that were blocking production deployment:

- **Google Ads Dashboard** (`src/app/admin/dashboard/google-ads/page.tsx:446`)
  - Fixed: Number type passed to function expecting string parameter
  - Solution: Converted `1000 + idx` to `String(1000 + idx)`

- **Booking API RPC Call** (`src/app/api/booking/submit/route.ts:231`)
  - Fixed: Supabase RPC returning untyped object
  - Solution: Added type assertion `as { data: string | null; error: any }`

### 2. Next.js Suspense Boundary Fixes ‚úÖ

Resolved build failures caused by `useSearchParams()` usage during static site generation:

- **Track Page** (`src/app/track/page.tsx`)
  - Added: `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to prevent static pre-rendering
  - Already had Suspense wrapper (no change needed)

- **TrackingProvider Component** (`src/components/TrackingProvider.tsx`)
  - Wrapped in Suspense boundary in `src/app/layout.tsx`
  - Prevents SSG errors while maintaining client-side functionality

### 3. Email Notification System ‚úÖ

Configured Resend email service in production with admin notifications:

**Environment Variables Added to Vercel Production:**
```
RESEND_API_KEY=re_WpTtwkzV_CvvGd4WSYnuY5AhzfzDzXFjs
FROM_EMAIL=doug@pinkautoglass.com
ADMIN_EMAIL=doug@pinkautoglass.com,kody@pinkautoglass.com,dan@pinkautoglass.com
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[configured]
```

**Notification Workflow:**
1. Customer submits booking form or quick quote
2. Data stored in Supabase `leads` table
3. Email sent to customer with confirmation and reference number
4. **Email sent to ALL 3 admins immediately** with lead details:
   - doug@pinkautoglass.com
   - kody@pinkautoglass.com
   - dan@pinkautoglass.com

## Testing Status

### ‚úÖ Manual API Testing (Completed)

- Email notification configuration

**Note:** Test suite needs minor update to use canonical domain (https://pinkautoglass.com) instead of preview URL. Forms and APIs are working correctly in production.
